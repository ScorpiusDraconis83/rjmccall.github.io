Messages from the fading present

I don't particularly like blogs as a format; if I'm going to write something longform, I generally want it to represent my current thinking on the subject, and I find that blogging discourages that kind of thoughtful revision and maintenance. If you want to see the history of my thoughts here, I do keep it as a public github repository. If I want to post stream-of-consciousness, I'd rather just post to social media; currently I'm on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@rjmccall).

So here's my current thinking.
