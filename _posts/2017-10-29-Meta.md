I spend probably too much time on the internet, and as part of that I hang out in various programmer-inhabited places, and it sometimes happens that I answer questions about programming languages.  I happen to think that I'm pretty good at answering questions about programming languages, and someone agreed and told me that I should probably write them down somewhere more central, so that's what this idea.

I've chosen the name *Advanced Introductions* for a reason: this is not really how you should be learning a language from scratch.  For one, I answer questions as they come up and as the interest strikes me, so there's a lot of stuff that's not covered.  For another, most of the posts here assume a working knowledge of other concepts from the language.  The presumed audience here varies a lot, from an "advanced beginner" who's struggling with a tricky feature because they're missing one or two key concepts to a much more advanced programmer who's just curious about how something works.

Anyway, I know a lot about programming languages.  I have some reasonably strong background in the formal treatment of many kinds of programming languages, and I have worked on both highly dynamic languages like JavaScript and "System F" functional languages, but most of my experience is in the design and practical implementation of imperative, statically-typed languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift.
